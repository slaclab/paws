Description: paws: the Platform for Automated Workflows by SSRL 
        ==================================================
        
        
        Description
        -----------
        
        `paws` stands for the Platform for Automated Workflows by SSRL.
        It was conceived to serve as a fast, lean, and modular 
        workflow manager for image-like data.
        
        `paws` provides machinery 
        to build and execute data processing workflows,
        including an ever-growing library of Operations 
        that connect together to form a workflow 
        with somewhat of a directed graph structure.
        
        The core modules of `paws` 
        are pure Python and have very few dependencies.
        `paws` exposes a simple API
        that interacts with these core modules,
        for users to write scripts based on `paws`,
        or to import the `paws` API to perform
        back-end computations for other applications or widgets.
        The current state of `paws` is alpha-
        nothing has been tested, 
        and even less has been optimized.
        
        The `paws` package also includes a graphical application 
        built on the `PySide` `Qt` bindings.
        Through this GUI, users can build and configure workflows, 
        examine existing `paws` Operations,
        develop new `paws` Operations,
        and visualize the outputs of their workflows.
        Various simplified GUIs are currently in development
        for interacting with specific workflows. 
        
        
        Example
        -------
        
        Here is an example of how to use `paws` 
        to write a data processing script.
        Note: at the time this was written, 
        the example does not display in github.
        Open the source file for this README
        to see the example.
        Complete instructions are included in the user manual. 
        See the `doc` directory of this repository.
        
        This script performs a common diffraction data processing workflow:
        it reads some calibration parameters (in Nika format),
        converts them to PONI (PyFAI) format,
        reads an image, uses the calibration parameters 
        to calibrate and reduce the image with PyFAI,
        and windows the useful part of the data.
        After executing, the useful data is extracted
        and plotted using matplotlib.
        
        .. code-block:: python
            import paws.api
            from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
        
            mypaw = paws.api.start()
        
            # Start a workflow, name it
            mypaw.add_wf('test')
        
            # Instantiate operations, name them, add them to the workflow
            mypaw.add_op('read_cal','INPUT.CALIBRATION.NikaToPONI')
            mypaw.add_op('read_img','INPUT.TIF.LoadTif')
            mypaw.add_op('cal_reduce','PROCESSING.CALIBRATION.CalReduce')
            mypaw.add_op('window','PACKAGING.WindowZip')
        
            # Set up the input routing: 
            # WXDToPONI reads a WXDiff calibration result 
            # and translates it to PONI (PyFAI) format
            mypaw.set_input('read_cal', 'wxd_file',
            src='filesystem', tp='path', val='/path/to/file.nika')
        
            # LoadTif loads a tif image
            mypaw.set_input('read_img', 'path',
            src='filesystem', tp='path', val='/path/to/image.tif')
            
            # CalReduce takes a PONI dict and an image,
            # calibrates and reduces to I(q) vs. q
            mypaw.set_input('cal_reduce', 'poni_dict',
            src='workflow', tp='reference', val='read_cal.outputs.poni_dict')
            mypaw.set_input('cal_reduce', 'image_data',
            src='workflow', tp='reference', val='read_img.outputs.image_data')
        
            # WindowZip takes x and y data and a window (xmin<x<xmax),
            # outputs the x and y data that live within the window
            mypaw.set_input('window','x',
            src='workflow', tp='reference', val='cal_reduce.outputs.q')
            mypaw.set_input('window','y',
            src='workflow', tp='reference', val='cal_reduce.outputs.I')
            mypaw.set_input('window','x_min', src='text', tp='float', val=0.02)
            mypaw.set_input('window','x_max', src='text', tp='float', val=0.6)
        
            # Execute the workflow
            mypaw.execute()
        
            # Grab the reduced data
            q_I_out = mypaw.get_output('window','x_y_window')
        
            # Plot the reduced data
            plt.semilogy(q_I_out[:,0],q_I_out[:,1])
            plt.show()
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The full `paws` package is now available on PyPI.
        To install in a working Python (>=2.6,<3) environment, invoke `pip`:
        `pip install pypaws`
        
        The dependencies of `paws` are not yet properly declared in the package.
        In a near future version, the core and graphical modules will be distributed in separate PyPI channels,
        and the dependencies of individual Operations will be checked and handled at run time.
        
        
        Contribution
        ------------
        
        Contribution to `paws` is encouraged and appreciated.
        Whether you are a researcher looking to contribute operations to the `paws` library,
        or a software developer looking to contribute to the platform itself,
        the `paws` development team would love to hear from you.
        
        See the manual in the `doc` directory for basic instructions on contributing,
        and/or get in touch with the `paws` development team
        at `paws-developers@slac.stanford.edu`.
